Some of my hobbies and favourite pasttime activities include:
- Reading sci-fi novels
- Playing sports, especially Tennis and Badminton
- Watching movies
- Playing the guitar

The following is what I hope to achieve from [CSE 110](./README.md):
- [ ] Learn how to work in a large team to build software
- [ ] Understand the philosophy behind software engineering
- [ ] Build something cool and get better at my programming skills

## About me as a Programmer
The start of my programming journey coincided with the start of my love and fascination of the world of technology. It started with me trying to understand how different technologies work and slowly started experimenting with computers. Soon after, in junior year of high school, I decided I wanted to study Computer Science in college. 

Currently, I would say that I love to work on anything that is interesting and fun, be it useful or not. My go to programming language is C++ and Java, and using the Object Oriented design of these languages makes programming very easy according to me. I have build small projects in my spare time, the most significant being a program I wrote called [LargeInt](https://github.com/pratyush401/LargeInt) that allows a user to express extremely large integer, that otherwise could not be represented by a primitive data type in Java.

> My independent programming project: LargeInt
> 
> Programming language used: Java

```
File name: LargeInt.java
Can print out arbrirtarily large integers using various back-end data structures. Also carry out basic mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication on them.
